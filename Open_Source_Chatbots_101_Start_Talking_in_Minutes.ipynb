        "I have been many things, from teacher, to marijuana farmer, to now aspiring developer. I fell in love with generative AI through pure spite and skepticism. My friends showed me AI generated images of DnD characters in the spring of 2023 and I thought they looked awful. In an effort to prove Generative AI was not the next big thing I learned how to run models on my powerful gaming computer. I quickly went from unimpressed to genuinely inspired, moving from generating images to training models.\n",

        "Since then I have been coding daily, expanding my skillset from novice with python to proficient, and teaching myself JavaScript and TypeScript. I went from someone who dreamed of reading research papers, to comfortably following along with some of the densest cutting edge papers. I've completed multiple projects combining image and text generation that you can find on my website DungeonMind. All of my code is open source, so you can completely duplicate almost anything I've built.  "

        "    How: Try adjusting style:\n",
        "    - Casual Buddy: “You are a friendly assistant who jokes around with the user.”\n",
        "    - Strict Instructor: “You are a concise tutor who never uses more than 20 words per sentence.”\n",

        "    Idea: Expand your function map beyond UserDetail and ChatResponse.\n",
        "    Potential New Functions:\n",
        "    - Weather Inquiry: get_weather(city: str, date: Optional[str]) -> dict\n",
        "        - The model can output real-time weather calls (you’d stub or integrate a real API).\n",
        "    - Calculator: calculate(expression: str) -> float\n",
